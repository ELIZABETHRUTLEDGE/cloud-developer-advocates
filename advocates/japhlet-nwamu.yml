  ## Bio
    April Speight is an author and developer advocate based in Beverly Hills, CA. She began her professional career in the luxury and fashion industry and later transitioned into tech as a project manager and systems analyst. Her programming journey began with Python which led to her first published title [Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Bite+Size+Python%3A+An+Introduction+to+Python+Programming-p-9781119643821). During the summer of July 2019, she saw her first HoloLens 2 demo which integrated speech translation in real-time. This demo was the spark to her career in Mixed Reality.
    
    In January 2020, she and a team of 4 ambitious developers created Spell Bound, a VR learning experience designed to help children with dyslexia and dysgraphia learn letter formation and word recognition. Their team won Best in Learning, Education and Research as well as Best in Health and Wellness + Medical at the MIT Reality Hack. She has since taken on a role as a Sr. Cloud Advocate with the Spatial Computing technology team at Microsoft helping to onboard beginners in the XR space.
